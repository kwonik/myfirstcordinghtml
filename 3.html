        Family leave policies allow workers to take time off from their jobs to care for family members. Maternity leave
        is
        granted to mothers around the time of childbirth or adoption; paternity leave is reserved for fathers around the
        same
        time. After maternity and paternity leave end, parental leave provides gender-neutral leave for parents to care
        for
        small children. Many countries have separate programs that offer leave to care for a sick or elderly family
        member. In
        the United States, however, family leave policies often group together leave for new parents, leave to care for
        a family
        member with a serious illness or injury, and leave to care for an employeeâ€™s own illness or injury.
