  <p><h1>Policy</h1></p>
  Family leave policies allow workers to take time off from their jobs to care for family members. Maternity leave is
  granted to mothers around the time of childbirth or adoption; paternity leave is reserved for fathers around the same
  time. After maternity and paternity leave end, parental leave provides gender-neutral leave for parents to care for
  small children. Many countries have separate programs that offer leave to care for a sick or elderly family member. In
  the United States, however, family leave policies often group together leave for new parents, leave to care for a family
  member with a serious illness or injury, and leave to care for an employeeâ€™s own illness or injury.
