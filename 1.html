<p><h1>unpaid leave</h1></p>
  Unpaid leave refers to time off from work during which an employee retains their job, but does not receive a salary. 

Employees (in the U.S.) are permitted to take unpaid leave for:

Self-care, involving a serious health condition
Family emergency
Parental leave for birth or adoption of a child 
Transition of an employee or their spouse to active duty
Employers who issue a mandatory unpaid leave, also known as a furlough, usually do so in order to:

Lower company expenses during a difficult economic period
Cope with company setbacks and re-balance budget
Save costs during the off season (relevant for seasonal work)
Furloughs reduce the work hours, days, weeks, or months of an employee, and vary depending on the needs of the employer. Companies often implement a rotating furlough, in which they rotate employees to take their unpaid days at different times throughout the month. An alternative is to institute unpaid leave all at once, over a few consecutive weeks or months. 

Businesses which run only during certain seasons, often implement planned unpaid leave for employees. Ski resorts, for example, which only open in the winter, can let employees know ahead of time that they will only hire them during the active season.

Why should HR leaders care about unpaid leave?
Mandating unpaid leave to employees amidst a company setback can:

Lower expenses 
Eliminate the need to recruit new hires
Protect existing jobs 
Keep the company afloat until the economy improves
HR leaders should be mindful that unpaid leave does involve risks:

Employees gaining employment elsewhere 
Interrupts work progress and momentum  
Lowers the remaining employeesâ€™ motivation, engagement, and work productivity
What can HR leaders do to improve the employee experience during mandated unpaid leave?
HR leaders can alleviate some of the tension for furloughed employees through:

Transparently discussing company guidelines and country (and state) laws regarding unpaid leave, including:
No-work policy for employees (exempt and non-exempt)
Eligibility to use vacation days, or other paid time off, to receive wages 
Health insurance benefits
Notify employees in advance if possible (some companies are required by U.S. law.)
