      Parental leave, or family leave,
      is an employee benefit available in almost all countries.
      [1] The term "parental leave" may include maternity, paternity, and adoption leave;
      or may be used distinctively from "maternity leave" and "paternity leave" to describe separate family leave
      available to
      either parent to care for small children.
      [2] In some countries and jurisdictions, "family leave" also includes leave provided to care for ill family
      members.
      Often, the minimum benefits and eligibility requirements are stipulated by law.
