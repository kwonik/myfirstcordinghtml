  <p><h1>parental leave</h1></p>
  Parental leave, or family leave,
  is an employee benefit available in almost all countries.
  [1] The term "parental leave" may include maternity, paternity, and adoption leave; 
  or may be used distinctively from "maternity leave" and "paternity leave" to describe separate family leave available to either parent to care for small children.
  [2] In some countries and jurisdictions, "family leave" also includes leave provided to care for ill family members.
   Often, the minimum benefits and eligibility requirements are stipulated by law.
