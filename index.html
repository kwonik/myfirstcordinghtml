  <br>when I was a young person,i began my career as an actress<br>
  Whenever my mother wasn’t free to drive me into Manhattan for auditions,i would take the train from suburban Newjersey and meet my father -who would have left his desk at the law office where he work-
  and we would meet under the upper Plaform Arrivals and Departures sign in Peen station.<br>
  We would then get onto subway together and, when we surfaced, he would ask me.<br>
  <strong>which way is north?</strong> <br>
  I wasn’t very good at finding North at the beginning, but I auditioned fair amount  and my dad kept asking me
  <br>which way is north?
  Over time, I got better at finding it.
  <br>I was struck by that memory yesterday while bording the plane to come here.
  <br>Not just by how far my life has come since then, but by how meaningful that seemingly small lesson has been
  When I was still a child, my father developed my sense of diraction and now, as and adult, I trust my ablitiy to nevigate space.
  My father helped give me the confidence to guide through the world.
  <p>(2day)
  In late March, last year,2016, I became a parent for the firtst time
  <br>I remember the indescribable –and as I understand a pretty unversal- experience of holding my week-old son and feeling my prorities change on a cellular level.
  <br>I remember I experienced a shift in consciousness that gave me the ability to maintain my love of career and also cherish something else,someone else,so much,much more.
  <br>Like so many parents, I wondered how I was going to balance my work with my new role as a parent, and in the moment, I remember that the statistic for US’s policy on maternity leave flashed in my mind.
  American women are currenty entitled to <u>12 week’s unpaid leave.</u>
  <br>American men are entitled to nothing.
  <br>that information landed differently for me, when one week after my son’s birth I could barely walk.
  <br>That informations landed differently when I was getting to know a human who was completely dependent on my husband and I for everything, when I was dependent on my husband for most things, when we were relearning everything we thought we knew about our family and relationship.
  <br><strong>It landed differently.</strong></p>
  <p>(3days)
  Somehow,to be“we and every American parent were expected back to nomal”in under three months.
  Without income.
  I remember thinking to myself “If the practical reality of pregnancy is another mouth to feed in your home 
  and America is a country where most people are living paycheck to paycheck,
  How does 12 weeks unpaid leave economically work?
  The truth is for too many people “It doesn’t”
  One in four American women go back to work two weeks after giving birth because they can’t afford to take any more time off 
  than that.
  That’s 25% of American women.
  Equally disturbing, women who can afford to take the full 12weeks often don’t because it will mean incurring a “motherhood penalty”
  -meaning they will be perceived as less dedicated to their job and will be passed over for promotions and other career advancement.
  In my own household, my mother had to choose between a career and raising three children.
  -a choice that left her unpaid and underappreciated as a homemaker- because there just wasn’t support for both paths
  The memory of being in the city with my Dad is paticularly meaningful one. since he was the sole breadwinner in our house and my brothers and my time with him was always limited by how much he had to work
  And we were incredibly privileged family –our hardships were the stuff of other family’s dreams.
